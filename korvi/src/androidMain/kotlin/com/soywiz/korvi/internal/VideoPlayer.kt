        // fed.  There can be significant latency between submitting frame N to the decoder
        // and receiving frame N on the output, so we need to stay ahead of the game.
        //
        // Many video decoders seem to want several frames of video before they start
        // producing output -- one implementation wanted four before it appeared to
        // configure itself.  We need to provide a bunch of input frames up front, and try
        // to keep the queue full as we go.
        //
        // (Note it's possible for the encoded data to be written to the stream out of order,
        // so we can't generally submit a single frame and wait for it to appear.)
        //
        // We can't just fixate on the input side though.  If we spend too much time trying
        // to stuff the input, we might miss a presentation deadline.  At 60Hz we have 16.7ms
        // between frames, so sleeping for 10ms would eat up a significant fraction of the
        // time allowed.  (Most video is at 30Hz or less, so for most content we'll have
        // significantly longer.)  Waiting for output is okay, but sleeping on availability
        // of input buffers is unwise if we need to be providing output on a regular schedule.
        //
        //
        // In some situations, startup latency may be a concern.  To minimize startup time,
        // we'd want to stuff the input full as quickly as possible.  This turns out to be
        // somewhat complicated, as the codec may still be starting up and will refuse to
        // accept input.  Removing the timeout from dequeueInputBuffer() results in spinning
        // on the CPU.
        //
        // If you have tight startup latency requirements, it would probably be best to
        // "prime the pump" with a sequence of frames that aren't actually shown (e.g.
        // grab the first 10 NAL units and shove them through, then rewind to the start of
        // the first key frame).
        //
        // The actual latency seems to depend on strongly on the nature of the video (e.g.
        // resolution).
        //
        //
        // One conceptually nice approach is to loop on the input side to ensure that the codec
        // always has all the input it can handle.  After submitting a buffer, we immediately
        // check to see if it will accept another.  We can use a short timeout so we don't
        // miss a presentation deadline.  On the output side we only check once, with a longer
        // timeout, then return to the outer loop to see if the codec is hungry for more input.
        //
        // In practice, every call to check for available buffers involves a lot of message-
        // passing between threads and processes.  Setting a very brief timeout doesn't
        // exactly work because the overhead required to determine that no buffer is available
        // is substantial.  On one device, the "clever" approach caused significantly greater
        // and more highly variable startup latency.
        //
        // The code below takes a very simple-minded approach that works, but carries a risk
        // of occasionally running out of output.  A more sophisticated approach might
        // detect an output timeout and use that as a signal to try to enqueue several input
        // buffers on the next iteration.
        //
        // If you want to experiment, set the VERBOSE flag to true and watch the behavior
        // in logcat.  Use "logcat -v threadtime" to see sub-second timing.
